# How to Completely Remove a Local User Profile from a Windows Computer

If you've ever shared your Windows computer with someone else or created a local user account for testing purposes, you may need to remove their user profile from your computer. Windows does have a built-in feature for deleting user accounts, but it doesn't always remove the associated user profile files, which can take up valuable disk space.

To completely remove a local user profile from your Windows computer, you can use a PowerShell script called Remove-LocalUserProfileCompletely. This script will remove the user account from the local account database, delete the user profile directory, and remove the user profile from the registry. In this blog post, we'll walk you through how to use this script.

# Before we get started, we need to make sure that you have the necessary permissions to perform this task. You'll need to be logged in to Windows with an account that has administrative privileges.

# Step 1: Open PowerShell

First, you need to open PowerShell on your Windows computer. To do this, press the Windows key + X and select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)" from the menu. This will launch PowerShell with administrative privileges.

# Step 2: Copy and paste the script

Copy the script from the introduction of this blog post and paste it into the PowerShell window.

# Step 3: Specify the username

To remove the local user profile, you need to specify the username of the user account whose profile you want to remove. Replace "Username" with the actual username of the user account. For example, to remove the local user profile for the user "JohnDoe", you would use the command Remove-LocalUserProfileCompletely -Username "JohnDoe".

# Step 4: Run the script

Once you've specified the username, press Enter to run the script. The script will prompt you for confirmation before proceeding with the removal. If you're sure you want to continue, type "Y" and press Enter.

During the removal process, a progress bar will be displayed to show the progress and status of the removal. The script will first remove the user account from the local account database, then delete the user profile directory, and finally remove the user profile from the registry.

# Step 5: Verify the removal

After the script has completed, you can verify that the local user profile has been completely removed by running the Test-LocalUserProfileRemoved command. Replace "Username" with the actual username of the user account. If the command returns "True", the local user profile has been successfully removed.

# In conclusion, removing a local user profile from a Windows computer is a task that can be easily accomplished using PowerShell. By using the Remove-LocalUserProfileCompletely script, you can be sure that the user account and associated profile files have been completely removed, freeing up valuable disk space.
